# @ue-shed/protocol

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 9bd7735: Add Niagara review profiles, lit scene capture, automatic camera fitting, and matched dark/light backgrounds. Expose activity-window and poster selection helpers, material diagnostics, and a local verified video encoder while retaining saved-camera transparent capture.
- ff117a0: Add generation-bound Project Index counts through
  `countProjectIndex({ projectId, expectedGeneration, filters })`. Supply 1–16 `ProjectIndexFilter`
  values for maps, exact classes, class prefixes, class-name suffixes, or serialized names. Each
  value-based filter requires 1–64 non-empty values; empty filter lists are rejected. Overlapping
  matches count each package once. The production binary Catalog reads checked snapshot postings
  without transferring candidate headers, and the public helper validates result identity and generation.
- 2f1137a: Make Lit editor-camera tiles the default Map Capture backend, with shared exposure, disabled
  vignette, plugin-owned scene freezing, and asynchronous capture with cancellation cleanup. Add
  optional manual exposure and retain explicit legacy backends. New plans use 16-pixel gutters and
  disable fog. The default requires an unlocked rendering editor viewport and the updated camera plugin.
- 2760900: Add capture selection bounds and Lit capture readiness inspection, optional producer identity and plugin versions, actor catalog metadata, and structured Map Capture and Niagara progress. Expose library APIs and CLI workflows while retaining compatibility with producers that omit optional metadata and progress. Updated inspection operations require the advertised Core and Cameras capabilities.
- Inspect saved Blueprint graphs without launching Unreal through `readSavedBlueprint`, native IO,
  and the WASM inspection API. Return graph/node identities, saved positions, typed pins and defaults,
  canonical links, tagged node properties, and explicit coverage diagnostics. Inspection is read-only
  and limited to supported uncooked saved revisions; it does not compile or execute Blueprints.

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- Define Review Capture 1.5 with exact non-nil operation UUIDs, durable Unreal actor GUID
  locators, and bounded optional locator diagnostics shared by TypeScript and Unreal.

## 0.5.0

### Patch Changes

- Align this unchanged package with the synchronized UE Shed `0.5.0` suite release. There is no
  direct behavioral change.

## 0.4.0

### Patch Changes

- Align this unchanged package with the synchronized UE Shed `0.4.0` suite release. There is no
  direct behavioral change.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- bf27d37: Version the saved-world projection to v2 with finite effective location, quaternion rotation, scale,
  and direct root-component attachment evidence. Map History schema v2 records the new actor shape and
  distinguishes attachment, effective-transform, and transform-resolution changes.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 51c0e1b: Publish engine discovery, project launch, editor readiness, PIE, and editor-world control as the
  headless `@ue-shed/engine` library. Publish Config Explorer and Project Custodian with browser-safe
  contracts and Node service layers. Add portable Map Capture plans, editor-world previews,
  orthographic tile-pyramid capture, safe map control, and more precise JSON and provisioning
  contracts.

## 0.1.0

### Patch Changes

- 9c2cdce: Publish the stable 0.1 package set, including the headless Game Text and World Log Map History
  integration packages.
