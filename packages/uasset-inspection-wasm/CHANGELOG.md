# @ue-shed/uasset-inspection-wasm

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 64ca9bf: Inspect rich curve keys, Skeleton reference poses and bone indices, Sequencer float/double channels,
  bounded InstancedStruct values, and package/object metadata in UE 5.7 saved packages. Share the
  source-derived native layouts across native and WASM readers and preserve unsupported inner payloads.
- 64ca9bf: Use source-derived Unreal class and serialization models for supported saved assets. Share bounded
  native layout decoding between StringTables and enums, expose StringTable metadata in native and
  WASM inspection, and preserve saved string-table text identities.

### Patch Changes

- 64ca9bf: Reduce native parser allocation costs by borrowing struct names, formatting diagnostic paths only
  on failure, and reading sized arrays without cloning generated layouts. Reduce owned inspection
  memory for assets without Skeleton poses while preserving inspection JSON and analyzer behavior.

## 0.7.1

Align this package with the synchronized UE Shed 0.7.1 suite and exact internal dependency pins. There is no direct behavioral change.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- Align this unchanged package with the synchronized UE Shed `0.7.0` release. There is no direct behavioral change.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- Inspect saved Blueprint graphs without launching Unreal through `readSavedBlueprint`, native IO,
  and the WASM inspection API. Return graph/node identities, saved positions, typed pins and defaults,
  canonical links, tagged node properties, and explicit coverage diagnostics. Inspection is read-only
  and limited to supported uncooked saved revisions; it does not compile or execute Blueprints.

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- Align this unchanged package with the synchronized UE Shed `0.5.1` patch release. There is no
  direct behavioral change.

## 0.5.0

### Patch Changes

- Align this unchanged package with the synchronized UE Shed `0.5.0` suite release. There is no
  direct behavioral change.

## 0.4.0

### Patch Changes

  direct behavioral change.

## 0.3.0

## 0.2.0

- 51c0e1b: Align the unchanged public packages with the synchronized UE Shed `0.2.0` suite release.

## 0.1.0

### Patch Changes

- 9c2cdce: Publish the stable 0.1 package set, including the headless Game Text and World Log Map History
  integration packages.
