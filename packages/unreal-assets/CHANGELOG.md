# @ue-shed/unreal-assets

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- ff117a0: Add generation-bound Project Index counts through
  `countProjectIndex({ projectId, expectedGeneration, filters })`. Supply 1–16 `ProjectIndexFilter`
  values for maps, exact classes, class prefixes, class-name suffixes, or serialized names. Each
  value-based filter requires 1–64 non-empty values; empty filter lists are rejected. Overlapping
  matches count each package once. The production binary Catalog reads checked snapshot postings
  without transferring candidate headers, and the public helper validates result identity and generation.
- Inspect saved Blueprint graphs without launching Unreal through `readSavedBlueprint`, native IO,
  and the WASM inspection API. Return graph/node identities, saved positions, typed pins and defaults,
  canonical links, tagged node properties, and explicit coverage diagnostics. Inspection is read-only
  and limited to supported uncooked saved revisions; it does not compile or execute Blueprints.

    Improve Project Index discovery, header batching, refresh, and query transport. Bound native
    protocol-worker shutdown and preserve typed reader failures for recovery.

- ff117a0: Add versioned Game Text investigation presets and complete filtered JSON/CSV exports, retaining
  text identities, all occurrences, quality rules, coverage, and project provenance. Query models
  can export full matching results independently of paginated UI results.

    Expose browser-safe investigation metadata and CSV helpers, plus a separate Node file adapter
    with bounded preset reads and atomic output writes. Workbench and the CLI use these APIs for
    saved investigations and replay against an explicitly selected project.

### Patch Changes

- efb6898: Preserve native failure codes on `AssetReaderError` so clients can provide typed recovery for unsupported and unavailable readers, and expose Blueprint class evidence for Project Index candidate queries.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- bf27d37: Version the saved-world projection to v2 with finite effective location, quaternion rotation, scale,
  and direct root-component attachment evidence. Map History schema v2 records the new actor shape and
  distinguishes attachment, effective-transform, and transform-resolution changes.
