# @ue-shed/unreal-connection

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 5fd5bc7: Expose initialized live DataTable defaults and bounded actor/component row-reference lookup.
  Add an optional Unreal automation provider with explicit local-player input injection and owned
  CSV capture control, typed headless clients, shared contracts, and an authoring/automation source
  bundle. Existing hosts adopt the versioned UE Shed contracts without legacy native endpoints.

    Text values now carry their localization identity (snapshot 2.3, Apply 1.2): localized namespace and
    key, string-table entry, culture-invariant, or generated. Apply writes text from that identity,
    mints keys in the table package on request, and keeps identity for Apply 1.1 clients that rewrite an
    unchanged display string. Apply 1.2 refuses to remove a row whose text identity changed since
    review. Producer refusals are typed `UnrealConnectionError` codes. A new
    `editor-host` plugin bundle combines camera authoring with DataTable authoring.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 2760900: Add capture selection bounds and Lit capture readiness inspection, optional producer identity and plugin versions, actor catalog metadata, and structured Map Capture and Niagara progress. Expose library APIs and CLI workflows while retaining compatibility with producers that omit optional metadata and progress. Updated inspection operations require the advertised Core and Cameras capabilities.
- ff117a0: Add a headless selected Unreal target service with operation-scoped endpoint capture. Changing
  selection affects subsequent operations while active operations and their children retain their
  starting target. Review capture adapters can resolve an endpoint from an Effect at execution time.

    Expose browser-safe camera and world-observation contracts and pure helpers, plus an observability
    metrics entry point that does not load telemetry exporters. Existing root exports remain available.
